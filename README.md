# dotfiles

My personal dotFiles. Basically, for now there's nothing more than my
.vim and zsh configurations.

Some things will need to be installed to make this work: vim, zsh, oh-my-zsh
python2 and 3 (required for some vim plugins)

## Vim

Open vim, `:PlugInstall` and be happy

## Oh my Zsh

```
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
